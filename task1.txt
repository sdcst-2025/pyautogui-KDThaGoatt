example0.py
Explain what it does. What do the different lines do?

example0 sleeps for 3.5 seconds then prints the elapsed time.

import time imports the time module.
x =time.time() finds the amount of seconds that have passed since January 1st 1970 and attatches it to the variable x which becomes a float value of the epoch time.
print(x) prints the current epoch time that was set in the prior line.
time.sleep(3.5s) stops the program for the specified amount of time, putting it to sleep.
print("I went to sleep for 3.5 seconds") just prints that message.
now = time.time() finds the epoch time after the 3.5 seconds of the program being asleep.
print(f"elapsed time: {now - x} seconds") takes the epoch time after the 3.5 seconds of sleep and subtracts the first epoch time from when the program started, giving a precise amount of time passed while asleep.

example1.py
Explain what it does. Give a brief summary of the program
and explain the importance of each line.

example1 counts each second and prints an "alarm" every time the amount of seconds is divisible by either 10, 20, or 60.

alarms = [0,0,0] creates a list of three zeroes to fill in the values later on
delays = [10,20,60] creates a list of the times when alarms should go off
start = time.time() creates a float value of the starting epoch time
alarms[0] = start + delays[0] (and the other values) creates a float value of the epoch time of when each alarm should be triggered
While True just creates an infinite loop
for i in range(0,3) creates a for loop where i corresponds to the index of the alarms
now = time.time() finds the current time every time the loop runs
if now > alarms[i] checks each alarm to see if the current epoch time is greater than the epoch time set for the alarms
print(f"alarm {i} {delays[i]} second alarm has been triggered because now ({round(now,3)}) > alarm {i} {round(alarms[i],3)}") prints out every time an alarm is triggered and explains why it was
alarms[i] = now + delays[i] resets the alarm so it is able to be triggered again
time.sleep(1) stops the program for 1 second (so it counts seconds)
print(f"time elapsed is {round(time.time() - start,3)}") prints out the amount of seconds since you clicked start
